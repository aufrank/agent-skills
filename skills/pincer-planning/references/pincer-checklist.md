# Pincer Planning Checklist

## Top-down framing prompts
- What is the single sentence goal?
- What does success look like (measurable)?
- What constraints are hard (time, budget, tech, policy)?
- What is explicitly out of scope?

## Bottom-up inventory prompts
- What assets exist (docs, data, code, APIs)?
- What blockers or risks are already known?
- What dependencies or stakeholders are involved?
- What unknowns would change the approach?

## Convergence checks
- Do top-down goals conflict with bottom-up constraints?
- Are there missing capabilities or resources?
- Are assumptions stated and testable?
- What can be deferred vs. must be solved now?

## Question bank (AskUser)
- Which outcome matters most if we have to trade off scope?
- Are there non-negotiable constraints or policies?
- What existing assets should we reuse?
- What failure modes are most costly?
